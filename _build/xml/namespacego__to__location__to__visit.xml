:synopsis: Class for the GoToLocationToVisit state of the sub-finite state machine

.. moduleauthor:: Matteo Maragliano 4636216@studenti.unitge.it

This class is a state of the sub-state machine *move randomly*. This class has the aim to move the robot through the path computed in the previous state.
The path is taken from the :mod:`planner` client by taking its result provided by the respsctive server and then it is passed to the :mod:`controller` ones. This uses the :mod:`controller` to make the robot move through the points of the path.
This state is a little trivial since it is used both to move the robot from a location to another both to drive it to the recharging room when necessary and when possible.
Due to this as soon as the robot has a location that has to reach, this location is reached and then, depending of the variable shared by the Helper, it can be retrieved if the move was just a random movement or it was needed to reach a location from which check again the possibility to reach the recharging room.
The clients are taken from the helper object.

Clients:
:attr:`client`: aRMOR client used to update the timestamp of the robot and of the location the robot has just visited

:attr:`planner_client`: client from which it is taken the goal, which means the path just computed to be passed to the controller.

:attr:`controller_client`: client that makes the request to the respective server to move the robot through the path from the starting to the end position.
